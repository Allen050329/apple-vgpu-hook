## What This Project Is

This research project emulates Apple's paravirtualized GPU on the host. An unmodified macOS guest
uses Apple's own GPU drivers; our QEMU device and Rust backend decode the command stream and
execute it through Metal or Vulkan. We ship no guest driver.

`crates/reims-vgpu` supports three first-class pathways:

| Pathway | Host | Guest | Attach | Page shift | Backend | Boot |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| x86 macOS / Linux Vulkan | Linux x86_64 (KVM) | x86_64 macOS Metal guest | PCI (`reims-vgpu-pci`) | 12 | Vulkan | `vm/boot-x86.sh` |
| arm64 macOS / macOS Metal | Apple Silicon macOS (HVF) | arm64 macOS Metal guest | sysbus MMIO (`reims-vgpu-mmio`) | 14 | Metal-direct | `vm/boot-arm64.sh` |
| arm64 macOS / macOS Vulkan | Apple Silicon macOS (HVF) | arm64 macOS Metal guest | sysbus MMIO (`reims-vgpu-mmio`) | 14 | Vulkan through MoltenVK | `vm/boot-arm64.sh` |

Pathway-specific facts must be verified on the pathway being changed. Do not generalize from arm64
to x86, from Metal to Vulkan, or from one host GPU class to another.

## Main Components

- `vendor/qemu` - QEMU fork with the thin device shim: QOM, MMIO/BAR, IRQ/MSI, console/display
  integration, and HostOps plumbing.
- `crates/reims-vgpu` - Rust staticlib that owns protocol decode, device model, memory mapping,
  command planning/execution, scheduling, and Metal/Vulkan backend behavior.
- `crates/reims-vgpu/src/observe/` - crate-wide observability: fail logs, typed decline reasons,
  emission helpers, and gates.
- `vm/` - snapshot-revert boot scripts for arm64 and x86 guests.

Start with the owning source modules and nearby tests when changing device, decode, present, or
backend behavior. Keep durable design facts in tracked docs or code comments close to the behavior
they explain.

## Operating Principles

### C Is A Thin Shim

C and Objective-C in the QEMU path exist to connect QEMU to Rust. Keep product logic in
`crates/reims-vgpu`: protocol interpretation, resource state, scheduling, GPU encode, present model,
backend policy, and performance behavior belong in Rust.

### Never Fail Silently

If a decoded guest command is rejected, dropped, degraded, unsupported, or mis-executed, make the
reason visible. Use typed decline/refusal reasons and emit them through the always-on failure path
so `/tmp/reims-vgpu-fail.log` explains what happened.

Expected control flow should stay quiet. A resolver saying "not ready yet" or an intentionally
unbound `ref == 0` is not a failure. A real loss of guest work is.

### Measure Before Fixing

You cannot fix what you cannot measure. If we do not know what class of failure we are fixing, we
are operating blind and guessing.

Before landing a visual, protocol, performance, or translation fix, add or identify a log-level or
test-level proxy for the bug class. Screenshots are useful evidence, but they are not a regression
gate by themselves.

### Tests Define Done

If there is no test for it, it is not done. No test means a future agent can regress the changeset
without noticing.

Behavior changes need tests that fail without the change. Bug fixes need a focused synthetic case
or proxy test for the bug class. Run Rust tests serially with `-- --test-threads=1`; GPU-touching
tests are not safe to run in parallel.

### Do Not Overfit Fixes

Never special-case behavior for a screenshot, boot stage, pixel dimension, resource size, object id,
function name, pipeline ref, or observed content pattern. Implement the decoded API contract.

Temporary probes are fine when they collect evidence. Remove probe-only behavior before claiming the
fix. Do not turn observations into product heuristics.

### No Magic Numbers

Do not guess numbers because they fit one observation. Derive constants from the contract: SDK
headers, `sizeof`/`offsetof`, decoded guest fields, documented serializer output, or controlled
empirical measurement. Record the basis in the code, tracked docs, or the commit body when the
value is not obvious.

Guest page geometry is always explicit. Portable code takes `page_shift` or `page_size`; arch-fixed
helpers must say so in their names.

### Write Comments For The Code

Inline comments should explain the code as it exists now. Do not mention the prompt, a temporary
plan, a phase number, a section of an implementation plan, or the reason a plan asked for the
change. Plans are consumed and deleted; code comments outlive them and must not point at things
that no longer exist.

### Keep Claims Narrow

State exactly what you verified. A single green boot does not prove an entire class is fixed. Broad
claims such as "zero-copy everywhere" or "no fallback remains" require an audit of every place that
could falsify them.

## Support Matrix

arm64 and x86 are both first-class. Metal and Vulkan are both first-class where the host supports
them.

The Vulkan backend must support all four memory/DMA cells:

| | DMA available | No DMA available |
|---|---|---|
| Unified memory | Apple M-series / MoltenVK, Intel/AMD iGPU on Mesa | Unified-memory hosts with no sharing mechanism |
| Discrete memory | Discrete GPUs with a working sharing path | Discrete GPUs that require copy crossings |

Vulkan 1.2 is the baseline. Anything above Vulkan 1.2 must have a fallback or a capability-gated
path. Gate on capabilities, not vendor names, driver names, or API-version assumptions.

Host-pointer imports must stay windowed. Do not import the whole guest RAM VMA for GPU DMA; it pins
host RAM. Use the existing capped window resolver.

## Verification

Pick the pathway your change affects.

- Arm64: `vm/boot-arm64.sh --device reims-vgpu-mmio --testing`, then
  `scripts/screenshot-when-macos-host/screenshot-when-macos-host.sh /tmp/screen.png`
- x86: `vm/boot-x86.sh --device reims-vgpu-pci --testing`, then
  `scripts/screenshot-when-kde-plasma-host/screenshot-when-kde-plasma-host.sh -o /tmp/screen.png`

For Rust changes, run the relevant native tests serially from the repo root:

```sh
cargo test -p reims-vgpu --no-default-features --features backend-vulkan,host-window -- --test-threads=1
cargo test -p reims-vgpu --no-default-features --features backend-metal -- --test-threads=1
```

`backend-metal` is Apple-only; run that arm only on Apple hosts. Run the feature matrix from the
repo root when cfgs, features, backend boundaries, or shared Rust code change:

```sh
scripts/feature-matrix/feature-matrix.sh
```

Before and after long Rust test runs, sweep orphaned test binaries:

```sh
pkill -9 -f 'target/debug/deps/reims_vgp[u]-'
```

### A live A/B needs one binary per arm

`vm/boot-x86.sh` rebuilds QEMU on every boot, so two boots of "the same" tree are two binaries
unless the tree is committed and untouched between them. Comparing a boot against a result recorded
in an earlier session compares the change to the rig's drift as well, and this project has spent
whole sessions on the difference: five consecutive boots were read as a regression from the change
under test, and a sixth — the same binary with only that change switched off — showed the same
defect. It was three commits older, unbooted, and nobody had measured a control.

Measure the control on the binary you are testing. Where a behaviour cannot be switched off at
runtime, give it a gate first (`REIMS_VGPU_SAMPLED_RESIDENT_GATE_OFF`, `REIMS_VGPU_STORE_DEFER_OFF`,
`REIMS_VGPU_CONTENT_REUSE_OFF` are all this pattern) — that boot is cheaper than the session lost to
reading a stale baseline. To attribute a defect to a *commit*, build each arm from its own source
(`git checkout <ref> -- crates/ vendor/qemu && git submodule update --init vendor/qemu`) and run the
same harness on each.

### Never delete the live fail log

The device holds an append fd on `/tmp/reims-vgpu-fail.log` from a background writer thread. `rm`
unlinks the name and every later line goes to an inode nothing can open, so the boot produces empty
logs and no census — discovered after a 30-minute 14-round run. Move it instead, before the boot:

```sh
mv /tmp/reims-vgpu-fail.log /tmp/<arm>/fail-prev.log
```

### Vulkan validation layers without root

Sync validation (`SYNC-HAZARD-*`) names a read/write hazard at the command that causes
it. Five such hazards were found and fixed by hand on this rail before anyone tried it;
every one would have been a single log line. The device creates its instance with no
layers, so the loader's environment is the whole mechanism — and the layer package does
not have to be installed system-wide, which is what previously blocked this behind a
`sudo` password:

```sh
mkdir -p /tmp/vklayers && cd /tmp/vklayers
curl -sO https://geo.mirror.pkgbuild.com/extra/os/x86_64/vulkan-validation-layers-<ver>-x86_64.pkg.tar.zst
tar --use-compress-program=unzstd -xf vulkan-validation-layers-*.pkg.tar.zst
```

The layer manifest names its library relatively, so the extracted `usr/lib` has to be on
the loader's search path:

```sh
export VK_LAYER_PATH=/tmp/vklayers/usr/share/vulkan/explicit_layer.d
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/tmp/vklayers/usr/lib
export VK_LOADER_LAYERS_ENABLE='*validation*'
export VK_LAYER_SETTINGS_PATH=/tmp/vklayers/vk_layer_settings.txt
```

`vk_layer_settings.txt` is where sync validation is turned on and where the output goes
somewhere a repro can slice:

```text
khronos_validation.validate_sync = true
khronos_validation.report_flags = error,warn
khronos_validation.log_filename = /tmp/reims-vgpu-vkvalidation.log
khronos_validation.duplicate_message_limit = 3
```

Confirm the layer actually loaded before believing a clean run — `vulkaninfo --summary`
must list `VK_LAYER_KHRONOS_validation` under `Instance Layers`. A boot with sync
validation on is not a frame-rate or timing measurement.

## Commit Guidelines

Commit only work you wrote. Never commit third-party code or intellectual property, including Apple
software, firmware, disk images, `.mtlb`, AIR, or SPIR-V. Keep those artifacts ignored and local.
Reports may include original analysis, metadata, hashes, and reproduction steps, but no third-party
bytes or excerpts.

Each commit should have a detailed message body that states:

- Which component or pathway it touches.
- What behavior changed and why.
- What tests, clippy runs, feature-matrix checks, or live-VM verification were performed.
- What was not verified, if anything.

Rust commits should be warning-free under clippy with `-D warnings` for every affected matrix arm.
Use the appropriate subset for the host and change; the Metal command is Apple-only:

```sh
cargo clippy -p reims-vgpu --all-targets --features backend-metal -- -D warnings
cargo clippy -p reims-vgpu --all-targets --no-default-features --features backend-vulkan,host-window -- -D warnings
cargo clippy -p reims-vgpu --target x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu --all-targets --no-default-features --features backend-vulkan,host-window -- -D warnings
```

Do not hide warnings, skip an affected arm, or commit a dropped test count without calling it out.
