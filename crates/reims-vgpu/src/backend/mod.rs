//! - [`metal`] / [`vulkan`] = concrete backends (feature-selected), each
//!   **self-contained** in this crate (Metal via `metal`; Vulkan via `ash` +
//!   [`vulkan::engine`]).
//! - Draws, compute and blits do **not** come through this module. The live
//!   seams are `runtime/metal_draw::try_metal2vulkan_draw` → [`vulkan::engine`]
//!   on the Vulkan rail and `metal::render::render_core_mrt` /
//!   `metal::compute::compute_core` on the Metal rail; the runtime drives them
//!   directly.
//!
//! Metal indices/semantics are canonical (guest wire is serialized Metal).
//! Vulkan-only binding rewrites live only in [`vulkan`].

// `Status` is 264 bytes — six inline `(key, value)` fields, no allocation — and
// it is the `Err` of most of this module's functions, so `result_large_err` and
// `large_enum_variant` fire across it. Boxing is the lint's remedy and it is
// the wrong trade here: the payload is what makes every refusal name the check
// that refused (see `backend::metal::error::Status`), the type is `Copy` and
// compared by value at hundreds of sites, and the cost being complained about
// is stack traffic on a **failure** path. A new error type that is large for no
// such reason should still be boxed rather than added to this exemption.
